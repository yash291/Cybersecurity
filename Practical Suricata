sudo suricata -r sample.pcap -S custom.rules -k none
The -r sample.pcap option specifies an input file to mimic network traffic. In this case, the sample.pcap file.
The -S custom.rules option instructs Suricata to use the rules defined in the custom.rules file.
The -k none option instructs Suricata to disable all checksum checks.

jq . /var/log/suricata/eve.json | less
You can use the lowercase f and b keys to move forward or backward through the output. Also, if you enter a command incorrectly and it fails to return to the command-line prompt, you can press CTRL+C to stop the process and force the shell to return to the command-line prompt
The jq tool is very useful for processing JSON data, however, a full explanation of its capabilities is outside of the scope of this lab

jq -c "[.timestamp,.flow_id,.alert.signature,.proto,.dest_ip]" /var/log/suricata/eve.json
The jq command above extracts the fields specified in the list in the square brackets from the JSON payload. The fields selected are the timestamp (.timestamp), the flow id (.flow_id), the alert signature or msg (.alert.signature), the protocol (.proto), and the destination IP address (.dest_ip).

jq "select(.flow_id==X)" /var/log/suricata/eve.json
A network flow refers to a sequence of packets between a source and destination that share common characteristics such as IP addresses, protocols, and more. In cybersecurity, network traffic flows help analysts understand the behavior of network traffic to identify and analyze threats. Suricata assigns a unique flow_id to each network flow. All logs from a network flow share the same flow_id. This makes the flow_id field a useful field for correlating network traffic that belongs to the same network flows.

Use the jq command to display all event logs related to a specific flow_id from the eve.json file. The flow_id value is a 16-digit number and will vary for each of the log entries. Replace X with any of the flow_id values returned by the previous query
