Task 1. Identify network interfaces
  Use ifconfig to identify the interfaces that are available
  sudo ifconfig

Use tcpdump to identify the interface options available for packet capture:
  sudo tcpdump -D

Task 2. Inspect the network traffic of a network interface with tcpdump
  Filter live network packet data from the eth0 interface with tcpdump:
  sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -v -c5
  This command will run tcpdump with the following options:
  -i eth0: Capture data specifically from the eth0 interface.
  -v: Display detailed packet data.
  -c5: Capture 5 packets of data.
  
  Exploring network packet details
  In this example, you’ll identify some of the properties that tcpdump outputs for the packet capture data you’ve just seen.
  In the example data at the start of the packet output, tcpdump reported that it was listening on the eth0 interface, and it provided information on the link       type and the capture size in bytes:
  
  tcpdump: listening on eth0, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 262144 bytes
  On the next line, the first field is the packet's timestamp, followed by the protocol type, IP:
  22:24:18.910372 IP 
  
  The verbose option, -v, has provided more details about the IP packet fields, such as TOS, TTL, offset, flags, internal protocol type (in this case, TCP (6)),     and the length of the outer IP packet in bytes
  
  (tos 0x0, ttl 64, id 5802, offset 0, flags [DF], proto TCP (6), length 134)
  In the next section, the data shows the systems that are communicating with each other:
  7acb26dc1f44.5000 > nginx-us-east1-c.c.qwiklabs-terminal-vms-prod-00.internal.59788:
  
  The remaining data filters the header data for the inner TCP packet:
  Flags [P.], cksum 0x5851 (incorrect > 0x30d3), seq 1080713945:1080714027, ack 62760789, win 501, options [nop,nop,TS val 1017464119 ecr 3001513453], length 82

  The flags field identifies TCP flags. In this case, the P represents the push flag and the period indicates it's an ACK flag. This means the packet is pushing     out data.

  The next field is the TCP checksum value, which is used for detecting errors in the data.

Task 3. Capture network traffic with tcpdump

Capture packet data into a file called capture.pcap:
sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -nn -c9 port 80 -w capture.pcap &
This command will run tcpdump in the background with the following options:

-i eth0: Capture data from the eth0 interface.
-nn: Do not attempt to resolve IP addresses or ports to names.This is best practice from a security perspective, as the lookup data may not be valid. It also prevents malicious actors from being alerted to an investigation.
-c9: Capture 9 packets of data and then exit.
port 80: Filter only port 80 traffic. This is the default HTTP port.
-w capture.pcap: Save the captured data to the named file.
&: This is an instruction to the Bash shell to run the command in the background.


Use curl to generate some HTTP (port 80) traffic:
curl opensource.google.com
: The "Done" in the output indicates that the packet was captured.
When the curl command is used like this to open a website, it generates some HTTP (TCP port 80) traffic that can be captured.
ls -l capture.pcap

Task 4. Filter the captured packet data
Use the tcpdump command to filter the packet header data from the capture.pcap capture file:
sudo tcpdump -nn -r capture.pcap -v

This command will run tcpdump with the following options:

-nn: Disable port and protocol name lookup.
-r: Read capture data from the named file.
-v: Display detailed packet data.

You must specify the -nn switch again here, as you want to make sure tcpdump does not perform name lookups of either IP addresses or ports, since this can alert threat actors.

Use the tcpdump command to filter the extended packet data from the capture.pcap capture file:
sudo tcpdump -nn -r capture.pcap -X
-nn: Disable port and protocol name lookup.
-r: Read capture data from the named file.
-X: Display the hexadecimal and ASCII output format packet data. Security analysts can analyze hexadecimal and ASCII output to detect patterns or anomalies during malware analysis or forensic analysis.

 Hexadecimal, also known as hex or base 16, uses 16 symbols to represent values, including the digits 0-9 and letters A, B, C, D, E, and F. American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) is a character encoding standard that uses a set of characters to represent text in digital form.
